# About this handbook

[Portfolio Performance](https://portfolio-performance.info) has been available since 2012 to calculate the performance of an entire portfolio - across different accounts and portfolios - using the True-Time Weighted Rate of Return (TTWR) and Internal Rate of Return (IRR).

Portfolio Performance (PP) tries to stay as simple and intuitive and possible. However, it does not always work without explanations, and seen by the numerous questions in the [forum](https://forum.portfolio-performance.info). This manual is intended to accompany you on the first steps in PP, explain basic concepts, and document features that require further explanation.
